# Themes

This directory contains the themes I use for differnt formats of my resume.

|   Format  |   Theme   |   Credit  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|   HTML    |   elegant |   [jsonresume-theme-elegant](https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant) |
|   PDF     |   engineering |   [jsonresume-theme-engineering](https://github.com/skoenig/jsonresume-theme-engineering) |

### Why not fork?
I made a few small changes to each theme that I do not think warrents their own repo and npm package. This is the best way for me to make minor changes without needing to maintain packages.
